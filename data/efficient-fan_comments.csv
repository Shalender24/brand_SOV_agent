I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn‚Äôt as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won‚Äôt necessarily save you money ‚Äî because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.",3,2025-04-22T12:49:20Z,True,False,False,False,POSITIVE,0.9738

More understandable...

A traditional fan wont chnage the temperature of the air unless there is somethinf to take away the energy from the air thats being moved (such as a radiator with cold liquid inside of it). 

About the fans, there different types, more blades, less blades and more

Shorter less fans means less resistance allowing the use of motors from anywhere between 10W-50W. The fans with more blades usually come also at a bigger size and are paired with motors from anywhere between 60W up to 300W.
Material of the fans also has its differences. Plastic fans dont allow to be made super thin simply bcs the plastic will degrade quicker and will also be weak when move with a great speed. Metal fans are the best, even tho they are a bit louder. They can be made super thin which removes most of the friction with the air therefore being able to push more air while spinning at lower rpm (And here 3 blades desing is actually the more preferred, bcs its the cheapest and as efficient). The fans that come with more fan blades are usually the ones used in big barns, factories and other and therefore they are labeled as heavy industries fans or blowers. 

Dont think that the air moved by your fan is colder, the fact is that when the air is staying at one place without being moved at all for a long time, the moisture in it tends to stack at a single place also in a big quantity. What the fan does is by moving the air it makes sure that all the moisture doesnt build up in the room (in particular at a stationary position in the air even close to the ceiling of the room).
Fan blades move the air with certain pressure, this pressure exactly is what makes that refreshing feeling of being hit by a breeze, even tho its the exact same temperature as of outside. And the outer temp is usually a lot bigge if there is sun (if it says its 35¬∞C, standing on the ground where the sun has heated up everything the temp will be around 4-8¬∞C higher.",2,2025-07-28T20:17:30Z,False,False,False,False,POSITIVE,0.9793

     If the fan needs a little help to get going, especially on low speed, it probably means that the waxy/semi-solid ""bearing"" that holds the shaft has begun to dry out and it does not get any better. lol I think it's built in obsolence. Instead of a true bearing that's part of it and it's probably cheaper to manufacture.

I took apart a couple of fans in a row, that this happened to both after about 5 years or so, different brands. All these budget fans seem to be the same nowadays. I had thrown out a couple over the years thinking the motor itself had siezed but necessity being what it was at the time, I decided to tear it apart and see if I could fix it.

Where the shaft sits inside the motor instead of a traditional bearing there is some kind of wax that begins to dry up and turn solid so the shaft won't turn or turn easily if starting on lower speeds. When it first begins happening you can usually get it to start on it's own by turning up the speed then lowering it or pushing it gently.

I have gotten several more years out of both, but one finally died completely. I happened to have some kind of old waterproof grease that my uncle told my father to buy from like 30 years ago... lol A small white contatiner that originally he told us to buy to fix the float mechanism in the toilet or something.

I just happened to see it in the bottom of his tool box that we kept after his passing and serveral times took apart the fan and applied that to the shaft and inside where the dried out ""bearing"" used to be. THE OLD STUFF HAD BECAME SOLID AND CRACKED AND BROKE INTO PIECES.

Each time it helped get the fan working again and it's been over a year since the last time I used it now... I'm guessing I'll need it sometime soon but this fan which was of pretty decent quality I've gotten at least 4 or 5 extra years out of...

The ""grease"" is terribly smelly and lasts a few days to a week for the smell to dissappear even off your hands if you touch it. And getting this grease off your hans is truly not easy.
    *_IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE, PLUMBERS SILICONE GREASE BUT I CAN'T SWEAR TO IT AND CAN'T GET TO IT RIGHT NOW. BUT THE SMALL CONTAINERS ONLINE LOOK SIMILAR_*

But to get anywhere from 3 - going on like 6 years extra now, it's worth it. And remember that the gap left from the missing bearing if you attempt this is much larger than the waterproof grease can fill up so it's purely I think helping with the friction even though the shaft doesn't seat itself snuggly like with the old dried out ""bearing""

Unfortunately besides the Dreo no other silent fans were part of this test.
And checking all 6k reactions I notice that hardly anyone is aware of some of these great options, which can help you to keep cool without annoying noise.
I'm thinking of silent brands are Xiaomi (or Mi), Duux, Levoit and of course the original (which Mi and Duux let themselves ""inspire"" heavily by...) and very expensive Balmuda Greenfan.

From the only one reaction mentions the Duux Flex and one mentions the Xiaomi Standing fan.
The Xiaomi is the one I personally have experience with and having both 4 in my own apartment and in our holiday home should make clear that I like those a lot for their silent perfomance and build quality.
I've got the in several versions and the (relative) budget ones perform almost just as good and silent as the more expensive ones, mostly differing in options.

First, you did an excellent job thinking through the data collection and limiting your variables. Top marks for thinking like an R&D Engineer! Remember that the toroidal fan design is meant to reduce the tip vortex for propellers that are 10% the size, are turned by brushless motors rotating at 15k - 100k RPM, and have tip speeds ranging from Mach 0.6 to 0.9. The fluid dynamics will be much different in these parameters than in those produced by room fan with a cage and brushed motors. 

Second, you tested one toroidal fan blade design, and (un)fortunately, that's not enough to make a definitive statement on the concept as a whole. The blade's pitch and/or twist rate, the number of blades, the various radius of the tip, the stiffness of the material, the blade's surface finish, and many other factors play a role in the accustic performance and power efficiency, and changing any of them will yield shockingly different results.

Third, people get their doctorates in this science and still struggle to conceptualize all of these design factors, so don't feel bad about having a lack luster first result. You're doing great! Keep on trying!",39,2025-07-07T14:25:09Z,False,False,False,False,POSITIVE,0.9863
